# EverGreen

About 85% of Grassland has been removed or substantially altered for agriculture and urban development. The leftover grasslands are mostly overlooked or to be used for overgrazing, as a result, much of  Australian grassland has disappeared since the arrival of European migrations.

This is the proposal report created for the project which aims to renew the leftover Australian grassland with minimal efforts. The website based application will allow user access through the latest information through image analysis technology. Science has progressed and now it is more convenient to obtain professional soil quality analysis data through images. A proper report will be exhibited that states the probable usage of the land and suggestions that what can be done to improve the fertility of the soil, so as to improve the production capacity of the land, and grassland regeneration etc. In this proposal we will explore the potential user stories and personas, such as farmers or relevant government agencies, different users may have different requirements for using our project. We will analyse these demand cases to provide solutions that meet the needs of users, in order to make this happen, we will make some assumptions.

Our ultimate goal is to save the remaining Australian grassland and hope to provide opportunities for grassland area growth through our project.
