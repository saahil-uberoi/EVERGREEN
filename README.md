# Evergreen | MelGrass

About 85% of Grassland has been removed or substantially altered for agriculture and urban development. The leftover grasslands are mostly overlooked or to be used for overgrazing, as a result, much of  Australian grassland has disappeared since the arrival of European migrations. Native grasslands of Victoria are now rare & less than 1% is remaining and are considered an endangered ecological community.

This project aims to provide the children between the age of 9 & 12 with an informative web application that would educate the kids with various habitats found in the grasslands alongwith the species that reside within. The project aims to do this through the medium of a game.

Our ultimate goal is to save the remaining Australian grassland and educate kids about the grasslands species and generate awareness amongst them through the medium of technology.
