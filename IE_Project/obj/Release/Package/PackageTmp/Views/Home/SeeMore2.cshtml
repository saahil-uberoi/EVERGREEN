                        History of Victorian Grassland
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        When Europeans first arrived in western Victoria, much of the extensive undulating plains they saw were covered with native grasslands.
                        However, starting from the 1830s, the local grasslands were quickly occupied because grazing there did not require much effort. Soon after,
                        large areas of native grassland in Victoria were completely replaced by introduced pastures, crops and weeds.
                        For people living in Victoria, the Victoria Volcanic Plain,
                        located from the west of Melbourne to the border of South Australia, is the largest natural grassland nowadays, but compared to the pre-European colonial era, it has only 5% of the area left.
