                        Grassland Ecosystem of Victoria Volcanic Plain
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The natural temperate grassland of the Victoria Volcanic Plain is a highly fragmented and critically endangered ecological community.
                        It is well known that the largest native animals on the Australian grassland is the kangaroo, the biggest of which is the red kangaroo, characteristic of the natural grassland in the dry inland areas.
                        But because of the arrival of European immigrants, mammals introduced from other continents have become equally common.
                        These animals include domestic animals, especially cattle and sheep, as well as a series of wild animals such as camels, horses, donkeys and goats.
                        The biggest natural enemy to the grassland is the European rabbit, they are widely distributed, have strong reproductive ability, and their destructive power is also amazing.
                        However, Australia does not have large predators, so the main predator is dingo. There are very diverse reptiles, especially lizards, and various birds including large flightless emu, and various parrots.
