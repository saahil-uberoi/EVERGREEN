                        Grassland is a vegetation area dominated by almost continuously covered grass, and it is also one of the most widely distributed main vegetation types in the world.
                        Usually natural grassland can be considered as the middle part of the environmental gradient, with forest at one end and desert at the other end.
                        The grassland plays an important balancing role for the earth's environment.
